- 👋 Hi, I’m @githero20 or Omogbai Atakpu (in the real-world).
- 👀 I’m interested in Web applications, data structures & algorithms among others.
- 🌱 I’m a big fan of single page applications, and as you may expect- React. Also very interested in offline-first and progressive web applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PWAs, SPAs, and other kinds of web applications. Open source (unpaid) invites also welcome.
